# Imagine you and your friends had a fantastic day at an ice cream parlor, trying out different flavors. You want to create a program that helps you analyze your ice cream adventure!
#  Can you write a Python program that takes input on how many scoops of each flavor you all had,
#  and then calculates the total number of scoops, the average number of scoops per flavor, and identifies the most popular flavor(s)?
#  You can use the statistics module to help you calculate the mean, median, and mode!

# HINT:

# ï»¿import statistics is used to import the statistics module, which provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (real-valued) data.
# The calculate_mean function calculates the mean (average) of a list of numbers using the statistics.mean function.
# The calculate_median function calculates the median (middle value) of a list of numbers using the statistics.median function.
# The calculate_mode function calculates the mode (most common value) of a list of numbers using the statistics.mode function.
# The main function is the main entry point of the script. 
# It prints a welcome message and instructions for the user to enter the number of scoops of each ice cream flavor they had, separated by spaces.
# It then reads the input, converts it to a list of integers, calculates the total number of scoops, 
# and calculates the mean, median, and mode of the scoops using the defined functions. Finally, it prints the results.
