# Using the concept of OOP, show him how we can create a class of the car.
#  With parameters(brand, color, weight, height, and length) also add methods for start, stop, increase speed, decrease speed, 
#  turn on headlights, and turn off headlights. 
# Also, create different objects(cars) using the class car.
